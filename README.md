# ASG2-PlayPal

First of all, please ignore the repo name. The project idea was changed after the repo was created, and so it was not changed due to potential errors stemming from changing it.

## Design Process

Something here.

## Features

## Technology

For this project, fairly few external technologies were used.

- [jQuery](https://jquery.com/)
  - This was used to simplify DOM navigation and AJAX calls to the RestDB API (mentioned below).
- [RestDB](https://restdb.io/)
  - This was used to provide a NoSQL DB for use to store information PlayPal relies on, like user and transaction data. It's accessed externally though a RESTful API.
